<h2>BZip2, the odd kid in my compression world</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Bzip2 is a fascinating algorithm. It is very different when compared to other
compresseion techniques I've come across. I've been pretty invested in the
Lempel-Ziv land of compression algorithms (yes, I'm going to use "algorithm"
and "technique" interchangeably throughout the article) which is probably why
bzip2 feels like a breath of fresh air to me right now.
<br><br> 
Now obviously, since the BWT is not a compression algorithm in the sense that
it does not actually reduce the number of bytes requires to store data, it has
to be used alongside other known algorithms like RLE, and Huffman compression.
These techniques I am familiar with, because the beginning of my compression
journey happened with these techniques. These techniques also appear in other
techniques like gzip due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
<br><br>
Since I'm going to explore bzip2, its documentation and codebase, I might as
well document what I learn. In the event that I forget what I have
studied, this might come in handy. And who knows, maybe this article catches
the eye of someone looking for something interesting and gets inspired by it?
<br><br>
Okay, okay. I'll stop rambling. Lets get on with it.
<br>
<h3>Some theory first</h3>
I'll fill this in at some point not that far into the future.
<br>
<h3>Exploring the codebase</h3>
It is quite easy to get lost in the code if one doesn't follow a strategy
while doing so. That doesn't mean you won't get lost if you do follow a
strategy but in this regard I'm a "something is better than nothing" kind
of a guy.
<br><br>
My strategy is going to be simple. Follow the code path for compression of
data from one flat buffer (array) to another. Following this, I will repeat
the same for decompression. This seems to be a good place to start.
