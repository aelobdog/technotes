Hi !
<br><br>
Welcome to TechNotes.
<br><br>
TechNotes is primarily a personal project, built by me and built for me.
It is meant to be a scratchpad for me to write about things I find interesting
and about any exploration that I do in them.
<br><br>
<i>
I'm sure this is obvious, but in case it isn't, anything I write in these notes
is my opinion and mine alone; At no point are they a reflection of the views or
the position of my employer (past, present or future), or anyone else. It also
goes without saying that the notes are not meant to be some kind of a factual
report, so to say, and the reader is advised to be careful when (if) quoting from
here for whatever purpose.

<br><br>
With all this legal mumbo jumbo out of the way, enjoy the content !
<br><br>
If you find anything on here that's interesting, explore more and reach out to
me so I can further my understanding too.
