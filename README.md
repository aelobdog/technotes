# TechNotes

TechNotes is a collection of articles/notes/observations on technical stuff I find interesting.

Of course it goes without saying that these notes reflect my understanding of the subject matter
under considerations and therefore might have inaccuracies/errors. If you wish to help me better
by understanding, or in case you simply wish to correct an error you found, feel free to reach
out to me through email at dev.ashwingodbole@gmail.com

Cheers !
